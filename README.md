# What's that?

This com.bob.test.game is developed as my master thesis project. It uses the LPS Framework for the logic part and LibGDX for the graphic part.

# Updates of the com.bob.test.game
- **0.4** Saving feature added (levels now need to be unlocked one by one)
- **0.3** Macro mode added
- **0.2** More levels added + new Reader mode
- **The beta 0.1 is available.** The game is fully playable. 4 levels are available for the moment! Enjoy.

# Cool, how do I try it?

For the moment you can import the project using gradle. The only things to do is to make the resource folder the working directory.

 An executable version will soon be available
